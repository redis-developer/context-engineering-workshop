    "\n",
    "## From RAG Basics to Practical Context Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "In Module 2, you built a working RAG system and saw why context quality matters. Now you'll learn to engineer context with professional-level rigor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What makes context \"good\"?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This module teaches you that **context engineering is real engineering** - it requires the same rigor, analysis, and deliberate decision-making as any other engineering discipline. Context isn't just \"data you feed to an LLM\" - it requires thoughtful preparation, quality assessment, and optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Engineering Mindset:**\n",
    "- Why context quality matters (concrete impact on accuracy, relevance, cost)\n",
    "- The transformation workflow: Raw Data → Engineered Context → Quality Responses\n",
    "- Contrasts between naive and engineered approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Engineering for Context:**\n",
    "- Systematic transformation: Extract → Clean → Transform → Optimize → Store\n",
    "- Engineering decisions based on YOUR domain requirements\n",
    "- When to use different approaches (RAG, Structured Views, Hybrid)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction to Chunking:**\n",
    "- When does your data need chunking? (Critical first question)\n",
    "- Different chunking strategies and their trade-offs\n",
    "- How to choose based on YOUR data characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context Preparation Pipelines:**\n",
    "- Three pipeline architectures (Request-Time, Batch, Event-Driven)\n",
    "- How to choose based on YOUR constraints\n",
    "- Building reusable context preparation workflows\n",

    "   - Verbose formatting (indentation, field names repeated)\n",
    "\n",

    "3. **No Filtering**\n",
    "   - Student asked about ML, but got all courses, even irrelevant ones\n",
    "   - **Dilutes relevant information with noise**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Poor Response Quality**\n",

    "\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of vector search optimization techniques in Redis,\n",
    "examining the trade-offs between search quality, latency, and memory usage. We evaluate multiple\n",
    "indexing strategies including HNSW and FLAT indexes across datasets ranging from 10K to 10M vectors.\n",
    "Our results demonstrate that careful index configuration can improve search latency by up to 10x\n",
    "while maintaining 95%+ recall. We also introduce novel compression techniques that reduce memory\n",
    "usage by 75% with minimal impact on search quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "Vector databases have become essential infrastructure for modern AI applications, enabling semantic\n",
    "search, recommendation systems, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Redis, traditionally known\n",
    "as an in-memory data structure store, has evolved to support high-performance vector search through\n",
    "the RediSearch module. However, optimizing vector search performance requires understanding complex\n",
    "trade-offs between multiple dimensions...\n",
    "\n",
    "[... 5,000 more words covering methodology, experiments, results, discussion ...]\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Background and Related Work\n",
    "Previous work on vector search optimization has focused primarily on algorithmic improvements to\n",
    "approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search. Malkov and Yashunin (2018) introduced HNSW, which has\n",
    "become the de facto standard for high-dimensional vector search. Johnson et al. (2019) developed\n",
    "FAISS, demonstrating that product quantization can significantly reduce memory usage...\n",
    "\n",
    "[... 2,000 more words ...]\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Performance Analysis and Results\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 HNSW Configuration Trade-offs\n",
    "\n",
    "Table 1 shows the performance comparison across different HNSW configurations. As M increases from 16 to 64,\n",
    "we observe significant improvements in recall (0.89 to 0.97) but at the cost of increased latency (2.1ms to 8.7ms)\n",
    "and memory usage (1.2GB to 3.8GB). The sweet spot for most real-world workloads is M=32 with ef_construction=200,\n",
    "which achieves 0.94 recall with 4.3ms latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Table 1: HNSW Performance Comparison\n",
    "| M  | ef_construction | Recall@10 | Latency (ms) | Memory (GB) | Build Time (min) |\n",
    "|----|-----------------|-----------|--------------|-------------|------------------|\n",
    "| 16 | 100            | 0.89      | 2.1          | 1.2         | 8                |\n",
    "| 32 | 200            | 0.94      | 4.3          | 2.1         | 15               |\n",
    "| 64 | 400            | 0.97      | 8.7          | 3.8         | 32               |\n",
    "\n",
    "The data clearly demonstrates the fundamental trade-off between search quality and resource consumption.\n",
    "For applications requiring high recall (>0.95), the increased latency and memory costs are unavoidable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Mathematical Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The recall-latency trade-off can be modeled as a quadratic function of the HNSW parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "Latency(M, ef) = α·M² + β·ef + γ\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- M = number of connections per layer (controls graph connectivity)\n",
    "- ef = size of dynamic candidate list (controls search breadth)\n",
    "- α, β, γ = dataset-specific constants (fitted from experimental data)\n",
    "\n",
    "For our e-commerce dataset, we fitted: α=0.002, β=0.015, γ=1.2 (R²=0.94)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Implementation Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our findings, we recommend the following configuration for real-world deployments:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Optimal HNSW configuration for balanced performance\n",
    "index_params = {\n",
    "    \"M\": 32,                  # Balance recall and latency\n",
    "    \"ef_construction\": 200,   # Higher quality index\n",
    "    \"ef_runtime\": 100         # Fast search with good recall\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This configuration achieves 0.94 recall with 4.3ms p95 latency, suitable for most real-time applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Discussion and Conclusion\n",

    "- ✅ No pre-processing required\n",
    "- ✅ Simple to implement\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",

    "- ❌ Repeated work (same transformations for every query)\n",
    "- ❌ Not suitable for large datasets\n",

    "## Summary and Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Context is Data - and Data Requires Engineering**\n",
    "- Context isn't just \"data you feed to an LLM\"\n",
    "- It requires systematic transformation: Raw → Clean → Transform → Optimize → Store\n",
    "- Engineering discipline: requirements analysis, design decisions, quality metrics, testing\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. The Data Engineering Pipeline**\n",
    "- Extract: Get raw data from sources\n",
    "- Clean: Remove noise, fix inconsistencies\n",
    "- Transform: Structure for LLM consumption\n",
    "- Optimize: Reduce tokens, improve clarity\n",
    "- Store: Choose storage strategy (RAG, Views, Hybrid)\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Three Engineering Approaches**\n",
    "- **RAG:** Semantic search for relevant data (good for specific queries)\n",
    "- **Structured Views:** Pre-computed summaries (excellent for overviews)\n",
    "- **Hybrid:** Combine both (best for real-world use)\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Chunking is a Design Choice, Not a Default**\n",
    "- **\"Don't chunk\"** is a valid strategy for structured data (courses, products, FAQs)\n",
    "- Consider chunking when documents have multiple distinct topics or need retrieval precision\n",
    "- Three strategies: Document-Based, Fixed-Size, Semantic\n",
    "- Choose based on YOUR data type, query patterns, and application requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Context Pipeline Architectures**\n",
    "- **Request-Time:** Process on-the-fly (simple, always fresh, higher latency)\n",
    "- **Batch:** Pre-process in batches (fast queries, can be stale)\n",
    "- **Event-Driven:** Process on changes (real-time, complex infrastructure)\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Quality Optimization**\n",
    "- Define domain-specific quality metrics\n",
    "- Systematic optimization: Baseline → Experiment → Measure → Iterate\n",
    "- Four dimensions: Relevance, Completeness, Efficiency, Accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Engineering Mindset\n",
    "\n",
    "Every decision should be based on **YOUR specific requirements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Analyze YOUR data:** Size, structure, update frequency, topic density\n",
    "2. **Analyze YOUR queries:** Specific vs. overview, single vs. cross-section\n",
    "3. **Analyze YOUR constraints:** Token budget, latency, quality requirements\n",
    "4. **Make informed decisions:** Choose approaches that match YOUR needs\n",
    "5. **Measure and iterate:** Test with real queries, measure quality, optimize\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember:** There is no \"best practice\" that works for everyone. Context engineering is about making deliberate, informed choices based on YOUR domain, application, and constraints."
