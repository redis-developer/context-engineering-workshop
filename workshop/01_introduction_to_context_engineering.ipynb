    "Over the past few years, AI applications have undergone rapid evolution. Early on, engineers built a polite clerk behind a glass window: users would slide a note - \"draft this email,\" \"explain this code\" — and the clerk would read it, scribble an answer, and slide it back. Their answers were generally good, but not always what we wanted. \n",
    "\n",
    "Users quickly realized that if they *precisely* engineer what the note says, they can, in turn, achieve better results from the clerk. So, they used more precise instructions — \"act as my editor,\" \"use this tone,\" \"return a table\" — and the outputs became sharper. This, in turn, became the practice of prompt engineering. \n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt engineering took users further, but eventually showed its limits — especially with our clerk behind the glass. We kept hoping the wording would stick, but longer notes got slow and contradictory. Tiny phrasing swings changed behavior in ways that were hard to predict or control, and no amount of wordsmithing seemed to fully fix it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a while, if you were building with these systems, a common playbook for solving these issues was simple: upgrade the model. Swap in the latest version and your clerk gets sharper responses, a better grasp of nuance, and enough capability to attempt specialized tasks like research or creative exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, teams weren't just waiting for better models, they were experimenting with everything they could. Some tried teaching the clerk through examples right there in the note: \\\"Here's how you handled a similar question before — now do it again.\\\" This became known as few-shot prompting. Others added step-by-step reasoning scaffolds — \\\"Think through this carefully, show your work\\\" — which we now call chain-of-thought. A few teams went further, fine-tuning their own versions of the clerk for specific domains, essentially retraining them on company-specific knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "And then there was retrieval. Instead of hoping the clerk remembered everything, engineers started handing them reference documents alongside each note: \\\"Here's the relevant policy,\\\" \\\"Here's what the customer said last week.\\\" This pattern — Retrieval Augmented Generation, or RAG — turned out to be one of the most practical techniques of the era.\n",
    "\n",
    "These approaches helped! The clerk began to catch more nuances in the notes that were passed. It could juggle longer instructions, synthesize more information, and make fewer obvious mistakes. For many teams, it felt like there were finally multiple knobs to turn, not just one.\n",
    "\n",
    "But under the hood, the old cracks were still there. The clerk was still working mostly from whatever happened to be on the note in front of them. They still forgot everything between one visit and the next. When they didn’t know something, they still guessed instead of checking. In other words, we’d upgraded the clerk, but not the glass, not the office, and not the way work flowed around them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then came agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of a clerk answering one note at a time, we started asking that same clerk to run tasks, such as breaking down a goal, fetching information from the internet, and reading and updating complex code. Our polite assistant became a kind of project manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our metaphor, it was as if we took the clerk from behind the glass and said: \"Feel free to walk the halls. Use the phone, dig through the filing cabinets, talk to other departments, and come back with a finished result.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This unlocked striking capabilities — but it also made the old problems impossible to ignore. Small ambiguities in instructions ballooned over ten or twenty steps. Missing background information meant the clerk confidently walked in the wrong direction for minutes at a time. Every task and its associated subtasks came with its own little note — its own tiny prompt — and suddenly the clerk wasn't wrestling with one interaction, but with a swarm of them, all slightly inconsistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what do these issues look like if we were to crack open one of these agentic applications? Where do \"missing background,\" \"forgotten preferences,\" and that \"swarm of tiny prompts\" actually live?\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, they all appear as distinct components of context surrounding a model call: the state and history you carry forward, the prompts and policies you apply, the memories you load, the documents you retrieve, and the structured outputs you expect to receive back. Visually, it looks something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Context engineering overview](../public/ce-overview.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Things like user input, operational databases, web APIs, and data warehouses all feed into the application’s context layer. Everything inside that dashed red circle is what we, as engineers, design and control before a single token ever reaches the LLM model. Instead of only asking, \"What’s the right prompt?\" or \"What’s the right model?\", we are now shifting to ask, “What information should be present at every step of this process, and how do we control it?”\n",
    "\n",
    "That shift — from crafting individual notes to deliberately shaping the information surrounding the application — is what has become known as context engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now ground this idea in an example application for a Redis University course agent and watch where context engineering makes the difference."

    "\n",
    "We can imagine, that at most universities today, one of the biggest pain points for learners is the time-suck of researching and selecting their academic classes for the year. In most cases, this involves a tedious process of waiting for their registration time slot to open (as often more senior students have priority), scrolling various pages of courses/descriptions, finding if they meet the prerequisites, and so on. There are even dedicated roles designed to help students decide on what classes are the right fit and assist them with their planning. \n",

    "## A Fundamental Challenge: Context Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "Even the most powerful AI models can only process a fixed amount of text in a single request. This is called the **context window**, which is essentially the size of our anecdotal clerk's desk. Here are the context window sizes of some of the most popular models available:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Model | Context Window |\n",
    "|-------|----------------|\n",
    "| GPT-4o | 128,000 tokens (~96,000 words) |\n",
    "| GPT-4o-mini | 128,000 tokens (~96,000 words) |\n",
    "| Claude 3.5 Sonnet | 200,000 tokens (~150,000 words) |\n",
    "\n",
    "This limit might look generous, but when we break it down, we have a ton of different context competing for space. Here is an example context budget breakdown for a single turn using a modeL:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "┌─────────────────────────────────────┐\n",
    "│   CONTEXT WINDOW - 128K tokens      │\n",
    "├─────────────────────────────────────┤\n",
    "│ System Context    │ 2,000 tokens    │  ← AI's role and rules\n",
    "│ User Context      │ 1,000 tokens    │  ← Your profile\n",
    "│ Conversation      │ 4,000 tokens    │  ← What we've discussed\n",
    "│ Retrieved Info    │ 5,000 tokens    │  ← Relevant data\n",
    "│ Your Query        │ 100 tokens      │  ← Current question\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That remaining space (111,900) might look comforting but remember this is just one turn. Our inputs will likely only grow longer (especially around conversation history), and as they do models have a harder time producing effective results. In fact [Chroma](https://www.trychroma.com/) revealed a critical challenge in working with LLMs: [context rot](https://research.trychroma.com/context-rot) - the phenomenon where LLM performance degrades non-uniformly as input context length increases, even on simple tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we summarized the research findings around the size of context in a AI system, it would break out into the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Longer context ≠ better context: Reliability drops and accelerates as inputs grow. This means we should treat the window like working memory; budget tokens when possible and keep the slice small.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Relevance rules: High semantic match drives accuracy; loosely related text hurts. We should prioritize optimizing retrieval precision (rerank, tighten filters, rewrite queries).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Distractors are toxic: Similar but wrong snippets do disproportionate damage as length increases. To reduce distractors, we should aggressively filter/threshold, dedupe, and avoid “just in case” context.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Placement & structure matter: Models attend unevenly across the window; key facts can be missed when buried. We should surface essentials early, chunk clearly, and summarize instead of pasting raw dumps. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, every token spent on one thing is a token NOT available for another. This means you must constantly decide:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Which context is most relevant?\n",
    "- What can be omitted without hurting quality?\n",
    "- When to retrieve more vs. use what you have?\n",
    "- How to compress long conversations?\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes context engineering a practice of optimization within constraints. As conversations grow longer, systems accumulate more data, and applications become more sophisticated, context management becomes increasingly critical."

    "## Other Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "While managing the size of your context window is critical, simply fitting everything in isn't the only hurdle. As D. Breunig highlights in [How Contexts Fail (and How to Fix Them)](https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/06/22/how-contexts-fail-and-how-to-fix-them.html), there are several other ways that context can degrade the performance of your agent, even when you are well within the token limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "He mentions four key failure modes to watch out for:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Context Poisoning**: This occurs when an error or hallucination makes its way into your context (e.g., conversation history) and is then treated as fact in subsequent turns. The model \"learns\" the wrong information from its own previous output, leading to a loop of compounding errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Context Distraction**: Sometimes, having *too much* history can be detrimental. If an agent has a massive log of past actions, it may start to over-focus on repeating those past behaviors rather than reasoning about the current, novel situation. It relies on its \"contextual habit\" instead of its training.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Context Confusion**: This happens when the context is cluttered with superfluous information—such as too many available tools or irrelevant document snippets. Even if the model *could* ignore them, the mere presence of these \"distractors\" increases the probability of the model getting confused or trying to use a tool that isn't needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Context Clash**: This is when different parts of your context contradict each other. For example, your system prompt might say one thing, but a retrieved document or an early turn in the conversation history says the opposite. When the model faces this internal conflict, its reasoning capabilities often degrade significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these failure modes reinforces why context engineering is not just about *compression*—it's about *curation*. We must actively manage, clean, and sometimes even \"forget\" context to keep our agents sharp.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we will not solve every one of these failure modes. Some, like context poisoning, remain as complex open research problems in AI. However, we will systematically dismantle the most common ones by building a series of \"progressive agents,\" each designed to overcome specific context limitations."

    "1. **Start simple, add complexity gradually** \n",

    "   - Add user context when you have it\n",
    "   - Retrieve additional context only when needed\n",

    "2. **Measure token usage continuously**\n",
    "   - Track how much of your context window is being used\n",
    "   - Set alerts before hitting limits\n",
    "   - Monitor growth patterns over conversation length\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Optimize for relevance, not completeness**\n",
    "   - Don't dump all available information into context\n",
    "   - Retrieve only what's relevant to the current query\n",
    "   - Filter and rank retrieved content by relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Use clear, structured formatting**\n",
    "   - Organize context with headers and sections\n",
    "   - Use bullet points and key-value pairs\n",
    "   - Make it easy for the model to find information\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Test different context combinations**\n",
    "   - Experiment with what to include vs. exclude\n",
    "   - Measure response quality with different strategies\n",

    "1. Context engineering is the practice of deliberately shaping the information surrounding an application, rather than just crafting individual prompts.\n",
    "2. There are four types of context we will focus on: system context, user context, conversation context, and retrieved context.\n",
    "3. All LLMs have fixed context windows, creating a fundamental constraint where every token used for one purpose is unavailable for another.\n",
    "4. Context rot is a phenomenon where LLM performance degrades as input context length increases, even on simple tasks.\n",
    "5. Context failures such as distraction, confusion, and clash occur when irrelevant or contradictory information is present in the context window.\n",
